# Version 1.2.1

## Support for new XRP control board 
* Updates appropriate firmware for the board
* Adds a block for the color LED


# Version 1.2.0

## Updated version of Micropython and XRPLib
There is now a version of Micropython that is specific to the XRP. Going forward from Micropython version 1.25.0 the XRP should use the XRP specific version of Micropython.
XRPLib has also been updated to work specifically with the XRP versions of Micropython.

### Fixed
* We needed to stop reseting Micropython when a program ended when we added bluetooth support, since that would also reset the bluetooth connection. This gave an added benefit of having all of your global variables and classes still in memory for debugging.
But this created a bug where the second time a program was run it could run out of memory. The memory is now cleared of all modules, except XRPLib, and variables that are not needed when the a program is run from XRPCode.
* The above fix also fixed a problem for programs that used more than one file. Updates to imported parts of the program are now updated each time the program is run.
* When using XRPCode over bluetooth there was a problem of missing characters in the terminal if a person was typing too fast. That has been fixed.
*  Updates of XRPLib were only being allowed if you were connected via a USB cable. You can now also update the library over bluetooth. Although it will always be much faster when using a cable.

#### Bluetooth support

# Please read the steps below!!

* Connect your XRP with a cable
* Let XRPCode upgrade the Micropython and XRPLib
* Under the RUN button will be the unique name of the XRP. You will want to write this on the XRP.
* Disconnect the XRP from the cable and turn on the XRP.
* When you click CONNECT select Bluetooth and it will bring up a list of XRPs that are not currently connected. (If your XRP does not show up press reset)
* Select your XRP and click Pair.
* Once connected XRPCode should be the same as if connected via a cable. YOU ARE NOW CABLE FREE!
* If the XRP is reset / turned off / too far away XRPCode will show RE-CONNECT XRP for 10 seconds and then switch to CONNECT.
    * If the XRP is turned back on / brought closer XRPCode will auto re-connect to the XRP within that 10 seconds
* If you start the XRP and a program runs keeping the bluetooth from connecting then press reset and it will restart without running the program

#### Fixed
* Input is now accepted in XRP applications
* The REPL stays live from run to run and has information from the last running program like globals and classes
    * When STOP is used the REPL is reset.
