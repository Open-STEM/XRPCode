# Version 1.2.3

## Better connection and program Stopping over bluetooth
We found a better way for handling the stopping of programs when connected via bluetooth. 
This will also help when connecting to an XRP that may already be running a program.
  
> IMPORTANT: You will not be able to connect via Bluetooth with this version of XRPCode until you update your XRP using a USB cable.

# Version 1.2.2

## Gamepad support
* After updating the XRPLib to version 2.1.3 or greater you can use a gamepad with XRPCode to drive your XRP. The Blocks palette has been updated with gamepad blocks.
* To drive your XRP you will need a program that responds to the gamepad interactions. There is a very small program in the XRPExamples directory. Be creative and create your own for different types of driving.
* We use the standard Web Gamepad support and recognize only one controller. If you want to know if your gamepad will work you can go to this <a href="https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">website</a> that will test if your gamepad is compatible with the web browser.
* If you don't have a gamepad you can use the keyboard. For the left joystick use WASD keys and for the right joystick use the IJKL keys. The number keys 1 - 0 are used for the buttons, in the same order as the pull down on the button gamepad block. There are no keys for the D-PAD.

## Waiting dialog box
We noticed that when connecting and stopping a program via bluetooth that different operating systems and versions take different amounts of time. We now put up a working dialog box to let you know the connection is still being worked on.

## Comment block added
If you would like to add comments to your Blockly program there is now a comment block. It can be found with the Text blocks.

# Version 1.2.1

## Support for new XRP control board 
* Updates appropriate firmware for the board
* Adds a block for the color LED


# Version 1.2.0

## Updated version of Micropython and XRPLib
There is now a version of Micropython that is specific to the XRP. Going forward from Micropython version 1.25.0 the XRP should use the XRP specific version of Micropython.
XRPLib has also been updated to work specifically with the XRP versions of Micropython.

### Fixed
* We needed to stop reseting Micropython when a program ended when we added bluetooth support, since that would also reset the bluetooth connection. This gave an added benefit of having all of your global variables and classes still in memory for debugging.
But this created a bug where the second time a program was run it could run out of memory. The memory is now cleared of all modules, except XRPLib, and variables that are not needed when the a program is run from XRPCode.
* The above fix also fixed a problem for programs that used more than one file. Updates to imported parts of the program are now updated each time the program is run.
* When using XRPCode over bluetooth there was a problem of missing characters in the terminal if a person was typing too fast. That has been fixed.
*  Updates of XRPLib were only being allowed if you were connected via a USB cable. You can now also update the library over bluetooth. Although it will always be much faster when using a cable.
